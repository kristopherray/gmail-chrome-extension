# Gmail Image Overflow Fix (max-width 100%)

A simple chrome extension to prevent overflow of massive inline images (thanks mostly to Apple Mail users). It will find all the images and set the max-width to 100%. Bam, no more horizontal scrolling to infinity. This will not effect the quality of the image, just how its displayed and prevent the container from growing with it.

Some really basic UX, makes you wonder why google hasn't just done this themselves?
